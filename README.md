# logistics-cost-efficiency-analysis
Data cleaning, transformation, and cost efficiency analysis of shipment logistics using R.
_____
**Overview**

This project analyzes shipment logistics data to evaluate delivery cost efficiency, carrier performance, and operational patterns. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and efficiency ranking to support data driven operational decision making.

**Tools and Technologies**

R
Tidyverse
dplyr
ggplot2
readxl
scales
knitr

**Project Focus**

Data Cleaning
Data Transformation
Exploratory Data Analysis
Cost Efficiency Analysis
Data Visualization
Reproducible Analytical Reporting

**What I Did**

Cleaned raw shipment data by handling missing shipment IDs, removing invalid cost records, and eliminating duplicate entries
Transformed data by calculating cost per KG KM to measure carrier efficiency
Standardized and reorganized variables to improve analytical structure and readability
Analyzed relationships between delivery time, shipment size, and delivery cost using regression based visualizations
Evaluated carrier performance by comparing shipment volume, average delivery cost, and cost efficiency metrics
Ranked carriers based on total cost per KG KM to identify relative efficiency differences
Built reproducible analytical workflow using R Markdown and structured reporting

**Key Insights**

Shorter delivery times generally correspond to higher shipment costs, suggesting a speed cost tradeoff
Clear variation exists across carriers in shipment volume and pricing patterns
Cost per KG KM revealed measurable differences in carrier efficiency
Shipment size shows a positive relationship with delivery cost, though variability exists
Carrier ranking highlights efficiency gaps that could inform operational optimization decisions

**Outcome**

This project demonstrates the ability to clean and transform messy real world data, construct efficiency metrics, and translate operational data into actionable insights. It highlights strengths in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and analytical storytelling using R.

**What I Learned**

How to clean and structure raw operational datasets for reliable analysis
How to build derived efficiency metrics from raw variables
How visualization and regression help uncover operational relationships
How to translate analytical results into clear, decision oriented insights
How reproducible reporting improves clarity, organization, and communication of analysis
